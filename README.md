# Phase 1 Project
## Overview

The demand for original content has grown exponentially across the globe, partly due to the rise of streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Disney + among others. This has opened up many new pathways for those interested in gaining a foothold in the film industry. Now, more studios are exploring ways to join in on the fun.

## Business understanding

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and wants to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they know nothing about creating movies. As they explore options for what type of films to create, they are interested in exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. In my analysis, I focused on financial success (in terms of revenue) as the measure of a movie's success and compare the genre, production budget, studio, and timing of release of movies to the average gross revenu generated by top perfroming movies in terms of revenue. The key questions I sought to answer were:

* ***Does the genre of a movie affect its financial success?
* ***Is there a correlation between the production budget dedicated to a film and its financial success?
* ***Does the studio that produces a movie influence its financial success?
* ***Is there a link between the time a movie is released and its financial success?

## Source of data
For my analysis, I used the movie datasets contained in the folder `zippedData` which were ontained from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

Specifically, I used the datasets from Box Office Mojo, TheMovieDB and The Numbers.

## Description of the data

Box Office Mojo dataset contained information about the production studio, domestic gross, foreign gross and year of release for 3387 movies. Similarly, TheMovieDB contained information about the release date, production budget, domestic gross and worldwide gross for 5782 movies. Majority of the movies contained in the two datasets were similar by title, domestic gross, and date of release.
Finally, The Numbers dataset contained information about 26517 movies ranging from the genre, original language, popularity, release date, vote average and vote count. Similar to the preceding two datasets, this dataset had various columns in common with The MovieDB dataset including the movie titles and release dates.

## Data analysis

To prepare the data for analysis, I merged the three datasets based on their common columns (movie title, domestic gross, and release date) to create one final dataset named 'combined_df'. I then cleaned this new dataset by correcting cases of missing values as well as decoding the genre IDs to obtain the respective genre names. Since the genre ids were encoded in numbers, I scraped the 'TheMovieDB' website for a guide that I used to decode the genres.
