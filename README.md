## Introduction

The demand for original content has grown exponentially across the globe, partly due to the rise of streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Disney + among others. This has opened up many new pathways for those interested in gaining a foothold in the film industry. Now, more studios are exploring ways to join in on the fun.

## Business context

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and wants to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they know nothing about creating movies. As they explore options for what type of films to create, they are interested in exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. In my analysis, I focused on financial success (in terms of revenue) as the measure of a movie's success and compare the genre, production budget, studio, and timing of release of movies to the average gross revenu generated by top perfroming movies in terms of revenue. The key questions I sought to answer were:

* Does the genre of a movie affect its financial success?
* Is there a correlation between the production budget dedicated to a film and its financial success?
* Does the studio that produces a movie influence its financial success?
* Is there a link between the time a movie is released and its financial success?

## Source of data
For my analysis, I used the movie datasets contained in the folder `zippedData` which were ontained from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

Specifically, I used the datasets from Box Office Mojo, TheMovieDB and The Numbers.

## Description of the data

Box Office Mojo dataset contained information about the production studio, domestic gross, foreign gross and year of release for 3387 movies. Similarly, TheMovieDB contained information about the release date, production budget, domestic gross and worldwide gross for 5782 movies. Majority of the movies contained in the two datasets were similar by title, domestic gross, and date of release.
Finally, The Numbers dataset contained information about 26517 movies ranging from the genre, original language, popularity, release date, vote average and vote count. Similar to the preceding two datasets, this dataset had various columns in common with The MovieDB dataset including the movie titles and release dates.

## Data analysis

To prepare the data for analysis, I merged the three datasets based on their common columns (movie title, domestic gross, and release date) to create one final dataset named 'combined_df'. I then cleaned this new dataset by correcting cases of missing values as well as decoding the genre IDs to obtain the respective genre names. Since the genre ids were encoded in numbers, I scraped the 'TheMovieDB' website for a guide that I used to decode the genres.

## Visualizations

### Analysis by genre
![genre](https://github.com/NazraJN/dsc-phase-1-project/blob/master/analysis%20by%20genre.JPG)

While most movies in the dataset are categorized across multiple genres, the top 10 highest grossing movie genres have elements of action and adventure across the board.

### Analysis by production budget
![budget](https://github.com/NazraJN/dsc-phase-1-project/blob/master/analysis%20by%20production%20budget.JPG)

The scatterplot shows a positive linear relationship between the production budget and worldwide gross, which indicates that movies with higher production budgets tend to have higher worldwide grosses. However, there is also quite a bit of variability in the data, with some movies having high worldwide grosses despite relatively low production budgets, and vice versa.

### Analysis by studio
![studio](https://github.com/NazraJN/dsc-phase-1-project/blob/master/analysis%20by%20studio.JPG)

From this graph, it is evident that major studios like Buena Vista(BV), Dream Works (P/DW) , Fox, Sony, WB NL(Warner Bros New Line), WB (Warner Bros), Universal(Uni), Paramount(Par), Strand, UTV, and MGM produced the highest grossing movies. Buena Vista studios had the highest number of top performing movies by revenue.

### Analysis by timing of release
![release](https://github.com/NazraJN/dsc-phase-1-project/blob/master/analysis%20by%20release.JPG)

This graph highlighlights months of peak audience for movie attendance. The highest grossing movies were released between May, June and July with the top grossing movies released in June, followed by May, then July. Moreover, many top grossing movies were also released in November and December.

## Conclusion
The main aim of this analysis was to examine what kind of films perform the best at the box office. The analysis relied on financial success as the measure of movie success and examined genre, production cost, studio and timing of release relative to financial success of a movie. The results showed that the most sccessful film genres are action and adventure movies. The analysis also revealed production budget as a significant contributor to box office success with movies with higher production budgets tending to yield higher average revenues. Further, the results also showed that release by a major studio had a positive impact on movie success. Major studios like Buena Vista, Dream Works, Fox, Sony and Warner Bros exhibited a history of producing films with consistently high revenues. Finally, the results highlighted a positive relationship between release time and movie success. Movies released around summer (May, June,July) and holiday seasons (November, December) earn higher revenues compared to other months.

## Recommedations 
Based on my findings, I recommend that Microsoft considers producing more movies in the action and adventure genres. It can pilot movies within these genres and assess their performance. Since these genres tend to yield higher revenues compared to other genres, producing more movies in these genres may increase their chances of success at the box office. Secondly, Microsoft should allocate higher budgets to movies to increase the chances of generating higher revenues. Finally, Microsoft should consider partnering with the studios that have a history of producing films with consistently high revenues to increase its chances of success at the box office.
